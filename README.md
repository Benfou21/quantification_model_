# Quantification Model

## Description

This project aims to implement and explore dynamic quantization models to optimize the performance of YOLO models for fire detection. Quantization reduces model size and improves efficiency while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

This repository includes:
- **Jupyter Notebook**: `Quantization_dynamic.ipynb` for model analysis and execution.
- **Folder**: "Weights" to store the weights of quantized models.
